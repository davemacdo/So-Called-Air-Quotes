# So-Called Air Quotes

This plugin allows you to show "air quote" icons in your site. This uses embeded fonts to match your site's built-in styles as easily as possible; but, it may not work in some older browsers. To use, simply place text inside the aq shortcode like [aq]this[/aq]. You can add a special style attribute for [aq style=open]open air quote icons[/aq] like this.

The icons were designed by me (David), and the font and icon CSS were generated by [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/). I'm not responsible for anything you do or that happens as a result of you using this plugin. Unless its good. In that case, you owe me royalties. Just remember that you're using software designed by a composer, which is almost certainly a bad idea.
